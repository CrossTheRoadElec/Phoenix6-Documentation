Swerve Project Generator
========================

.. important:: Full swerve project generation is only available for FRC users. However, non-FRC users can still generate the constants file.

Under the :guilabel:`Mechanisms` page in Tuner X is the Swerve Project Generator. This utility guides the user through configuring their modules, verifying their drivetrain, encoder inverts, drivetrain inverts and more.

.. note:: The generated swerve project utilizes the :doc:`Swerve API </docs/api-reference/mechanisms/swerve/swerve-overview>`.
