Log Analysis (Beta)
===================

Hoot logs can be directly viewed and analyzed in Tuner using the built-in Log Analysis tool. This tool can be found by navigating to :guilabel:`Tools` -> :guilabel:`Log Analysis (Beta)` tab. Users can take advantage of our high-performance :doc:`plotter </docs/tuner/plotting>` to analyze their logs for trends.
