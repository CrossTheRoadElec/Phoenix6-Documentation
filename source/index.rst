Phoenix Pro Documentation
=========================

Welcome to the Phoenix Pro documentation. Individuals looking for the `Phoenix 5` documentation may locate them `here <https://docs.ctre-phoenix.com/en/stable/>`__.

The Phoenix Pro software framework allows you to control and configure your `CTR-Electronics <https://store.ctr-electronics.com/>`__ Phoenix Pro Devices. Phoenix Pro represents a complete rewrite of the software framework over the existing Phoenix 5 framework. With Phoenix Pro, users have access to many new features that expand the control the user has over their device.

.. note:: A changelog containing API, Tuner and Firmware changes is available `here <https://api.ctr-electronics.com/changelog>`__ and a migration guide is available :doc:`here </docs/api-reference/api-usage/migration-guide>`.

Why Phoenix Pro?
----------------

Phoenix Pro currently offers the following features and will further expand:

* :ref:`Time Synchronization <docs/api-reference/api-usage/status-signals:canivore timesync>`

  - Using time synchronization (when using CANivore), users can accurately determine when a signal was measured and react synchronously.

* Canonical Units

  - Uses the popular `Units <https://github.com/nholthaus/units>`__ library for C++ and standardizes on SI units.

* :doc:`Comprehensive API </docs/api-reference/api-usage/index>`

  - Get API calls return a StatusSignalValue object that contain methods to refresh, wait for new data, and get the timestamp of the signal.
  - Control API is performed with request-specific control objects to reduce the parameter count while maintaining clarity on what the request does.

* Improved device control

  - New control modes such as FOC (`velocity-based <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_control_(motor)>`__ control) to take advantage of ~15% increased peak power.
  - Kalman based algorithms for velocity smoothing
