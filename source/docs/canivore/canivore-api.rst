CANivore API
============

All device constructors have an overload that takes a string CAN bus identifier. This identifier can be ``rio`` for the native roboRIO CAN bus, ``*`` to select the first available CANivore, or a CANivore's name or serial number. On non-FRC Linux systems, this string can also be a SocketCAN interface.

.. note:: If there are multiple CANivores with the same name, the system will use the first CANivore found.

If no CAN bus string is passed into the constructor, or the CAN bus string is empty, the behavior is platform-dependent:

- roboRIO: use the roboRIO native CAN bus
- Windows: use the first CANivore found
- non-FRC Linux: use SocketCAN interface ``can0``

``CANBus`` API
--------------

The ``CANBus`` API (`Java <https://api.ctr-electronics.com/phoenix6/latest/java/com/ctre/phoenix6/CANBus.html>`__, `C++ <https://api.ctr-electronics.com/phoenix6/latest/cpp/classctre_1_1phoenix6_1_1_c_a_n_bus.html>`__, `Python <https://api.ctr-electronics.com/phoenix6/latest/python/autoapi/phoenix6/canbus/index.html>`__) can be used to retrieve information about any given CAN bus, such as the bus utilization.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Java
      :sync: Java

      .. code-block:: java

         // retrieve bus utilization for the CANivore named drivetrain
         CANBusStatus canInfo = CANBus.getStatus("drivetrain");
         float busUtil = canInfo.BusUtilization;

         if (busUtil > 0.8) {
            System.out.println("CAN bus utilization is greater than 80%!");
         }

   .. tab-item:: C++
      :sync: C++

      .. code-block:: cpp

         // retrieve bus utilization for the CANivore named drivetrain
         CANBus::CANBusStatus canInfo = CANBus::GetStatus("drivetrain");
         float busUtil = canInfo.BusUtilization;

         if (busUtil > 0.8) {
            std::cout << "CAN bus utilization is greater than 80%!" << std::endl;
         }

   .. tab-item:: Python
      :sync: python

      .. code-block:: python

         # retrieve bus utilization for the CANivore named drivetrain
         can_info = CANBus.get_status("drivetrain")
         bus_util = can_info.bus_utilization

         if bus_util > 0.8:
            print("CAN bus utilization is greater than 80%!")

CANivore Status Prints
----------------------

When working with CANivore CAN buses in a robot program, Phoenix prints some messages to report the state of the CANivore connection. These messages can be useful to debug connection issues (bad USB vs bad CAN) or report bugs to CTR Electronics.
