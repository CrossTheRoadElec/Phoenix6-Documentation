==================

Phoenix 6 API used as part of `WPILib robot projects <https://docs.wpilib.org>`__ provides implementations of common WPILib interfaces that FRC teams use.

.. note:: While the Python API does support simulation, it currently does not hook into WPILib's simulation GUI at this time.
