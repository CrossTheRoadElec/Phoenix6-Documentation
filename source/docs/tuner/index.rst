===============

What is Phoenix Tuner X?
------------------------

.. note:: The legacy Phoenix Tuner v1 is still available for use and is installed as part of the Phoenix installer.

Phoenix Tuner is the companion application allowing you to configure, analyze, update and control your device. Users may choose to use either Phoenix Tuner v1 (included as part of the Phoenix Installer) or Phoenix Tuner X (`Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ctre.phoenix_tuner>`__, `Windows <https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/phoenix-tuner/9NVV4PWDW27Z>`__).

Phoenix Tuner X supports Android 8.0+ and Windows 10 (1903+) and Windows 11.

.. important:: While CTR-Electronics supports both Phoenix Tuner v1 and Phoenix Tuner X, certain features such as device licensing and improved batch upgrading are only available in Phoenix Tuner X.

.. tip:: Many UI elements contain hover tooltips. That means the user can hover over them with their mouse for a text explanation of what they do.
