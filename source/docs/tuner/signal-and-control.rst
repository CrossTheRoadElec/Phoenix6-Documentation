Multi-device Plot & Control
===========================

Multiple devices can be controlled and plotted simultaneously using the :guilabel:`Signal & Control` tab in Phoenix Tuner X. The interface mirrors the existing device details page, with dropdowns or comboboxes for choosing devices in a specific context.
