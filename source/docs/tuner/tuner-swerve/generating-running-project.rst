Generating the Project
======================

The robot program can be generated by clicking the :guilabel:`Generate Project` button. This will open a prompt asking for the team number for the generated project, followed by the programming language.

Alternatively, the constants file alone can be regenerated for an existing project using the :guilabel:`Generate only TunerConstants` button.

.. tip:: It's highly recommended to export the project settings using the Save As icon in the top-right. This will save time if the robot program or constants file needs to be regenerated for any reason.
